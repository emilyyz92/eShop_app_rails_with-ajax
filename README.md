bundle install #install Ruby gem dependencies
npm install #install all necessary JavaScript packages
rails server #start Rails server
```

The server will start, and go to localhost:3000 to start using the app.


## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* Customers can register accounts (or use Gmail 3rd party login), whose information (i.e., email, phone) will be accessible to store admin to contact the customer
* When an order is placed, store admin can fulfill the order, upon which inventories of the products will automatically reduce by the amounts in the order
* User can view product details, put items to cart, and place order all within the home page seamlessly.
